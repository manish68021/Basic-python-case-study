## Introduction

This repository contains a series of basic Python exercises that are intended to help beginners familiarize themselves with Python programming. Each exercise focuses on a specific aspect of the language, ranging from basic syntax to more complex concepts such as file handling.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your computer:

- Python 3.x
- A code editor or IDE (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm, or even a simple text editor)


## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Hello, World!

**Objective:** Write a Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

**Instructions:**

1. Create a new file named `hello_world.py`.
2. Write the code to print "Hello, World!".
3. Run the program to see the output.

### Exercise 2: Variables and Data Types

**Objective:** Practice using variables and different data types in Python.

**Instructions:**

1. Create a new file named `variables_and_data_types.py`.
2. Define variables of different types (e.g., integer, float, string, boolean).
3. Print each variable along with its type.

### Exercise 3: Conditional Statements

**Objective:** Learn to use if-else statements to make decisions in your code.

**Instructions:**

1. Create a new file named `conditional_statements.py`.
2. Write a program that takes an input from the user and prints whether it is positive, negative, or zero.

### Exercise 4: Loops

**Objective:** Understand how to use loops to repeat actions.

**Instructions:**

1. Create a new file named `loops.py`.
2. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.
3. Write another program that does the same using a `while` loop.

### Exercise 5: Functions

**Objective:** Practice defining and calling functions.

**Instructions:**

1. Create a new file named `functions.py`.
2. Define a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.
3. Call the function and print the result.

### Exercise 6: Lists

**Objective:** Learn to manipulate lists in Python.

**Instructions:**

1. Create a new file named `lists.py`.
2. Write a program that creates a list of five integers.
3. Print the list, then add an element, remove an element, and print the list again.

### Exercise 7: Dictionaries

**Objective:** Get familiar with dictionaries and their usage.

**Instructions:**

1. Create a new file named `dictionaries.py`.
2. Write a program that creates a dictionary with three key-value pairs.
3. Print the dictionary, then add a new key-value pair, remove an existing pair, and print the dictionary again.

### Exercise 8: File I/O

**Objective:** Learn to read from and write to files.

**Instructions:**

1. Create a new file named `file_io.py`.
2. Write a program that writes a string to a file.
3. Write another program that reads the content of the file and prints it.
